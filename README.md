## Problem Description
This challenge asks you to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this dataset. All of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.
The towns from which these routes originate are:

* Awendo
* Homa Bay
* Kehancha
* Kendu Bay
* Keroka
* Keumbu
* Kijauri
* Kisii
* Mbita
* Migori
* Ndhiwa
* Nyachenge
* Oyugis
* Rodi
* Rongo
* Sirare
* Sori
The routes from these 14 origins to the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi takes approximately 8 to 9 hours from time of departure. From the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi into the main bus terminal, where most passengers get off, in Central Business District, takes another 2 to 3 hours depending on traffic.
The three stops that all these routes make in Nairobi (in order) are:
Kawangware: the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi
Westlands

Afya Centre: the main bus terminal where most passengers disembark

All of these points are mapped here.

Passengers of these bus (or shuttle) rides are affected by Nairobi traffic not only during their ride into the city, but from there they must continue their journey to their final destination in Nairobi wherever that may be. Traffic can act as a deterrent for those who have the option to avoid buses that arrive in Nairobi during peak traffic hours. On the other hand, traffic may be an indication for people’s movement patterns, reflecting business hours, cultural events, political events, and holidays.
## Data Description
Nairobi Transport Data.csv (zipped) is the dataset of tickets purchased from Mobiticket for the 14 routes from “up country” into Nairobi between 17 October 2017 and 20 April 2018. This dataset includes the variables: ride_id, seat_number, payment_method, payment_receipt, travel_date, travel_time, travel_from, travel_to, car_type, max_capacity.

Uber Movement traffic data can be accessed here. Data is available for Nairobi through June 2018. Uber Movement provided historic hourly travel time between any two points in Nairobi. Any tables that are extracted from the Uber Movement platform can be used in your model.

## Variables description:
* ride_id: unique ID of a vehicle on a specific route on a specific day and time.
* seat_number: seat assigned to ticket
* payment_method: method used by customer to purchase ticket from Mobiticket (cash or Mpesa)
* payment_receipt: unique id number for ticket purchased from Mobiticket
* travel_date: date of ride departure. (MM/DD/YYYY)
* travel_time: scheduled departure time of ride. Rides generally depart on time. (hh:mm)
* travel_from: town from which ride originated
* travel_to: destination of ride. All rides are to Nairobi.
* car_type: vehicle type (shuttle or bus)
* max_capacity: number of seats on the vehicle
